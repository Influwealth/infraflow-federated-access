# Federated Wireless Access

This module defines how InfraFlow nodes obtain
lawful wireless access using shared spectrum.

Targets:
- CBRS (US)
- Private LTE / 5G
- Mesh backhaul

SAS Providers (pluggable):
- Google SAS
- Federated Wireless
- Amdocs
- CommScope

InfraFlow treats wireless as an ACCESS layer,
not the control plane.
