# InfraFlow Federated Access

InfraFlow Federated Access provides sovereign, quantum-secure access
to compute, identity, storage, and payments over existing networks.

This repository focuses on:
- Federated wireless access (CBRS, private LTE/5G, mesh)
- Post-quantum secure onboarding
- Cloud-independent routing into InfraFlow services

InfraFlow does NOT replace the internet.
It replaces dependency on centralized clouds.

## Core Principles
- Federated > centralized
- Compute sovereignty
- Post-quantum security by default
- Edge-first architecture

## Status
Early foundation. APIs and scripts are evolving.
