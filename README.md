## What is IFA?

**IFA (InfraFlow Federated Access)** is a federated, post-cloud access fabric that lets people, devices, and apps securely reach **compute, storage, identity, and payments** without depending on centralized cloud providers.

It runs on top of existing networks (internet, cellular, CBRS, private LTE/5G, satellite) while keeping your core services sovereign:
- Federated routing + node discovery
- Post-quantum cryptography (key material + identity)
- Capsule/app orchestration surfaces (MCP-UI)
- IPFS-based asset publishing for resilient distribution


This repository focuses on:
- Federated wireless access (CBRS, private LTE/5G, mesh)
- Post-quantum secure onboarding
- Cloud-independent routing into InfraFlow services

InfraFlow does NOT replace the internet.
It replaces dependency on centralized clouds.

## Core Principles
- Federated > centralized
- Compute sovereignty
- Post-quantum security by default
- Edge-first architecture

## Status
Early foundation. APIs and scripts are evolving.
